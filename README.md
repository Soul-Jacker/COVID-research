# COVID-research

The purpose of this project is to design an NLP model that will differentiate between empirical and non-empirical research on COVID.  The data come from DIMENSIONS, which has been curating COVID research and making the collection freely available.  

Dimensions created the data file using the following query:

>"2019-nCoV" OR "COVID-19" OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR "HCoV-2019" OR "hcov" OR "NCOVID-19" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2" OR “coronavirus disease 2019” OR (("coronavirus" OR "corona virus") AND (Wuhan OR China OR novel))

The current data export version used is 2020-07-03, which can be obtained from [Dimensions](https://dimensions.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dimensions_COVID-19_publications_datasets_and_clinical_trials/11961063) via Figshare.
